#Dashboard Description

##This Tableau dashboard offers a strategic overview of crime-related data in Springfield, intended for a Chief Officer. It focuses on three key areas:

*Crime Reporting Rates*: Visualizes the percentage of crimes not being reported for each postal area. This is crucial for understanding the extent of underreporting and identifying areas where outreach efforts are most needed.

*Victim Reporting Behavior*: Compares the number of victims who report a crime versus those who do not, broken down by postal area. This helps pinpoint regions where victims may be less likely to report incidents to authorities.

*Crime Trends*: Tracks the count of crimes over time for each postal region. This allows for the identification of emerging hotspots and potential trends that require proactive intervention.
